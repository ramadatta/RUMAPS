# RUMAPS

RUMAPS is a Python package designed to create refined UMAP visualizations with clean labeling and interactive exploration. Specifically, this package is created to fit in single cell analysis packages (scanpy and anndata).  RUMAPS provides intuitive tools to enhance your data visualization workflow.

---

## Key Features
- **Polished UMAP Visualizations**: Generate clean and well-structured UMAP plots with custom labeling.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Add hover text, search functionality, and custom layers to dive deeper into your data.
- **Streamlined Integration**: Seamlessly integrate RUMAPS into your existing data analysis pipelines with scanpy and anndata object.
- **Interactive UMAP HTML:**: Interactive UMAP visualizations can be saved and shared as HTML files, enabling ease of sharing and exploration.

## Installation

Install RUMAPS via pip:

```bash
pip install rumaps
```

    highlight_labels=["cluster1", "cluster2"], 
    highlight_label_keywords={"fontsize": 20, "fontweight": "bold", "bbox": {"boxstyle": "round", "pad": 1}}
)
```

```bash
rumaps.interactive.interactive_umap(
    adata=adata,
